### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Alessandro here, a post-doc biostatistician and [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) developer at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.

My current (_biostatistical_) research focuses on developing joint natural history models for latent breast cancer tumour growth and metastatic spread.

Other methodological topics I am interested in: statistical simulation, survival analysis, joint shared random-effects modelling (e.g. longitudinal-survival), computational statistics.

I am predominantly an [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) user, which you might have guessed if you already checked out the repositories around here, but use a good amount of [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) too.
I developed and currently maintain the following R packages available on CRAN:

* {rsimsum} [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsimsum), [GitHub](https://github.com/ellessenne/rsimsum)]
* {comorbidity} [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=comorbidity), [GitHub](https://github.com/ellessenne/comorbidity)]
* {KMunicate} [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KMunicate), [GitHub](https://github.com/ellessenne/KMunicate-package)]

You will also find a variety of experimental packages and code (with wildly variable maturity levels) [here](https://github.com/ellessenne?tab=repositories).

If you want to know more about me, feel free to check out my personal website at [ellessenne.xyz](https://www.ellessenne.xyz/) where I sometimes write about statistics, [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats), and whatnot.
Contact details are included there too if you want to get in touch.
