### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Alessandro here, a senior biostatistician and [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) developer currently working at [Red Door Analytics](https://reddooranalytics.se) in Stockholm, Sweden.

Some of my research interests are: statistical simulation, survival analysis, joint shared random-effects modelling (e.g. longitudinal-survival), computational statistics, statistical natural history models for breast cancer growth and spread.

I am predominantly an [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) user, which you might have already guessed, but use a good amount of [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) too.
I also like to fiddle around with other languages, such as C++, Python, SQL, and LaTeX, and I can write a good amount of HTML and CSS.

I developed and currently maintain the following R packages available on CRAN:

* {rsimsum} [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsimsum), [GitHub](https://github.com/ellessenne/rsimsum)]
* {comorbidity} [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=comorbidity), [GitHub](https://github.com/ellessenne/comorbidity)]
* {KMunicate} [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KMunicate), [GitHub](https://github.com/ellessenne/KMunicate-package)]

You will also find a variety of experimental packages and code (with wildly variable maturity levels) [here](https://github.com/ellessenne?tab=repositories).

If you want to know more about me, feel free to check out my website at [ellessenne.xyz](https://www.ellessenne.xyz) where I sometimes write about statistics, [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats), and other random stuff (tiny computers anyone?).
You'll find there contact details as well there if you want to get in touch.
