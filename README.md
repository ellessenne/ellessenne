### Hi there!

Alessandro here, a post-doc biostatistician at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. 
My (_biostatistical_) research interests focus of survival analysis, simulation methods, joint longitudinal-survival modelling; currently, I am working on developing statistical models for breast cancer growth and spread.

I am into all things data, [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) fun, and much more.
You can read more about me on my personal website, [ellessenne.xyz](https://www.ellessenne.xyz/).
