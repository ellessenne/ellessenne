### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Alessandro here, a post-doc biostatistician at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.

My current (_biostatistical_) research line focusses on developing joint natural history models for latent breast cancer tumour growth and time to event outcomes.

Other methodological topics I am interested in: statistical simulation, survival analysis, joint shared random effects modelling (e.g. longitudinal-survival), computational statistics.

I am an avid [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) user, which you might have guessed if you already checked out the repositories around here.
I maintain the following R packages on CRAN:

* {rsimsum} [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsimsum), [GitHub](https://github.com/ellessenne/rsimsum)]

* {comorbidity} [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=comorbidity), [GitHub](https://github.com/ellessenne/comorbidity)]

* {KMunicate} [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KMunicate), [GitHub](https://github.com/ellessenne/KMunicate-package)]

You will also find a variety of experimental packages (with wildly different maturity levels) [here](https://github.com/ellessenne?tab=repositories).

If you're looking for more information about me (or a full CV), check out my personal website at [ellessenne.xyz](https://www.ellessenne.xyz/) where I also write the occasional blog post.
And feel free to get in touch if you have any question, contact details are on my website too.
Cheers!
